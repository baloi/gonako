> a test:
  budget.txt becomes budget1.txt

> functions
  Assumptions:
    - everytime a budget function is called, budget is calculated?
    - everything in "done" should not be touched.
    - so how about start with one function, budget_calculate?

> budget_calculate
  - do not touch "done"
  - steps:
    * read budget and put it memory (array)
    * get current 2 weeks and next 2 week dates
    * if there are unpaid from last month, then overflow
    * if there are paid future then do not include... (read this from done)
    * extract the payments to be made for current 2 weeks
    * extract the payments to be made for next 2 weeks
    * write temporary budget (budget_temp.txt) 
    * check temporary budget and if correct, then write
      . checking does involve showing itemized list and maybe
        yes(y), no(n), ignore(i)
      . any(n) and the budget goes back to the books...
